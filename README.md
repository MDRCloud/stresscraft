State-of-the-art Minecraft stress testing software written in Kotlin.

## Disclaimer

StressCraft should **ONLY** be used in your own server environment. We do not endorse the use of StressCraft for any other purposes than testing your own infrastructure.

Please be aware that attempting to execute this with an external server as a target can be seen as **illegal** as it simulates a layer 7 DoS (denial-of-service) attack, which is against the law in most countries.

## How to use?

> **NOTE:** DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION, EVER.

- Ensure `max-players` (server.properties) is high enough for the number of bots you're planning to test
- Set `online-mode` (server.properties) to `false`
- Set `network-compression-threshold` (server.properties) to `-1`
- Set `connection-throttle` (bukkit.yml) to `-1`
- Increase `max-joins-per-tick` (paper.yml) to your liking
- Execute the jar with proper arguments

If you're on Velocity, you may also need to set `login-ratelimit` (velocity.toml) to `0`

## Docker Compose

This repository contains a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run the optional web interface in a container.
To build and start the service:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The web UI will be available on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To run the CLI instead, override the command:

```bash
docker compose run --rm stresscraft <host> [port]
```
